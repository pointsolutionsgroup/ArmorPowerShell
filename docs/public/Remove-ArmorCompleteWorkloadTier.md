# Remove-ArmorCompleteWorkloadTier

## SYNOPSIS
Deletes tiers in an Armor Complete workload.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-ArmorCompleteWorkloadTier [-WorkloadID] <UInt16> [-ID] <UInt16> [[-ApiVersion] <String>] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Workloads and tiers are logical grouping tools for helping you organize your
virtual machines and corresponding resources in your Armor Complete
software-defined datacenters.

Workloads contain tiers, and tiers contain virtual machines.

Workloads are intended to help you describe the business function of a group of
servers, such as 'My Secure Website', which could be useful for chargeback or
showback to your customers, as well as helping your staff and the Armor Support
teams understand the architecture of your environment.

Tiers are intended to describe the application tiers within each workload. 
A
typical three tiered application workload is comprised of presentation,
business logic, and persistence tiers. 
Common labels for each are: web,
application, and database respectively, but you can group your VMs however you
choose.

Returns a set of tiers in a workload that correspond to the filter criteria
provided by the cmdlet parameters.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
Remove-ArmorCompleteWorkloadTier -WorkloadID 1 -ID 1
```

Deletes the workload tier with ID=1 in the workload with WorkloadID=1 in the
Armor Complete account that currently has context.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
1, 2 | Remove-ArmorCompleteWorkloadTier -WorkloadID 1 -ApiVersion 'v1.0'
```

Deletes the workload tiers with ID=1 and ID=2 the workload with WorkloadID=1
using Armor API version v1.0 in the Armor Complete account that currently has
context.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
[PSCustomObject] @{ WorkloadID = 1; ID = 1 } | Remove-ArmorCompleteWorkloadTier
```

Deletes the workload tier with ID=1 in the workload with WorkloadID=1 in the
Armor Complete account that currently has context.
